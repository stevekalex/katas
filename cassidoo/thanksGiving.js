You're organizing a family meal. Given a list of dishes and their respective preparation times,
return the minimum number of hours required to prepare all dishes if you can cook up to two dishes simultaneously.
If a dish takes longer than the remaining time of the current hour, it will be moved to the next hour.

mealPrep([120])
2 // one single long dish

mealPrep([30, 30, 30, 20])
2 // multiple shorter dishes

mealPrep([30, 25, 45, 30, 60, 15])
3 // many dishes with varying times
